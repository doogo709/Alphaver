## Reporting a Vulnerability

How to report a vulnerability:

To report a vulnerability you must have proof of the vulnerability existing
such proof can be from a "File Unsafe" message when opening or downloading it
or it can be from corruption or from the code itself.

To report bugs go to the "Issues" tab on GitHub and open a ticket.

If your ticket is rejected then please do not report the bug again unless it has gotten worse.
